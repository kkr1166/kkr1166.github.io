<button class="collapsible">About My Students</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I offer private music composition lessons through Zoom. Most of my students are high schoolers interested in developing a composition portfolio for conservatory and music school applications. Many of my students found me through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TiaraTanka" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>, where I have posted videos about music school applications. My former students have been accepted to:</p>
    <div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li>Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California</li>
        <li>New England Conservatory of Music</li>
        <li>Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University, Bloomington</li>
        <li>Bienen School of Music at Northwestern University</li>
        <li>Belmont University School of Music</li>
    </ul>
        </div>

<button class="collapsible">My Teaching Style</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>While the quality of a piece of music is often considered subjective, there are many techniques that can be used to objectively improve a composition. In lessons, I focus primarily on these objective techniques, which include:</p>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
        <li>employing notational accuracy, specificity and clarity</li>
        <li>considering physical limitations and instrumental idioms</li>
        <li>understanding (but not necessarily applying) traditional counterpoint and orchestration principles</li>
        <li>utilizing proper harmonic spellings</li>
        <li>demonstrating structural foresight</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>I do not recommend regular, weekly composition lessons for most students. Composing is an extremely creative process, and too much structure and regularity can destroy the fun. I prefer scheduling irregular lessons at my students’ convenience to allow ample time for students to process feedback and develop new ideas independently.</p>

<button class="collapsible">My Background</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I began formal musical training at age six, when I had my first piano lesson. I continued taking weekly lessons for 12 years. I began playing flute at age nine, and started weekly flute lessons a few years later. In high school, I started practicing flute and piano more seriously and developed chronic back pain from overuse. In order to cope with the pain and resulting frustration, I began composing. I fell in love with the creative process and decided to apply to music schools for composition during my senior year of high school. I had also always enjoyed math and planned to pursue academics in some capacity at college.</p>
  <p class="extra">I was accepted to Northwestern University’s Bienen School of Music and Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, where I took a variety of music and STEM classes. I also studied composition privately with Hans Thomalla, Jay Yim, Alex Mincek and Chris Mercer. During college, I scored over 10 films, composed chamber and solo concert music and produced several original EDM and pop songs.</p>
  <p>In June 2020, I graduated from Northwestern University with a double major in Music Composition and Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences (MMSS), and a certificate in Financial Economics from the Kellogg School of Management. I received Program Honors in Composition and completed an MMSS thesis titled <q>A Geospatial Analysis of the Form and Migration of Crime: Hotspots in Los Angeles.</q></p>

<button class="collapsible">My YouTube Channel</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>In 2019, I started uploading videos to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TiaraTanka" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a> which has since generated over 50,000 views. My most popular videos are related to the college application process and life as a music student.</p>
