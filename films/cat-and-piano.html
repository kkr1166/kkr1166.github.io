<!--                    <p>A cat copes with loss through music and unexpected companionship in this heartwarming animation.</p>-->
                    <p>The animator injured his wrist playing basketball recently, so production is on hold for at least a few more weeks. In the draft above, the music is finished, but the animation will eventually be much clearer and in color.</p><br>
                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    <p>A curious and naive cat is adopted by an elderly pianist. The cat does not hesitate to explore his new home and falls from a cat tower moments after entering the house. The pianist catches the cat just in time, but the cat becomes more cautious after the fall. When the cat first hears the piano, he crawls under a sofa pillow in fear. Soon, the cat's fear is overpowered by curiosity, and he slowly approaches the piano. The pianist teaches him to play, and they bond through music.</p> <br>
                    <p>After some time, the pianist passes away. The cat is adopted by the pianist's daughter and grandchild. The grieving cat struggles to adjust to the new home. The cat discovers that the child owns an electric keyboard. The cat tries to teach the child the melody he learned from the pianist. Eventually, the cat realizes that the child knows the piece. While the cat plays the melody, the child harmonizes, and the two overcome loss together.</p>
